# Introductory Session

1) Simply duplicate the "opening session" provided in class.
2) Save the session to a file named
[`opening-session.txt`](
  {{ site.baseurl }}/sessions/introductory-session.txt) for subsequent use.

# Numeric Session

1) Simply duplicate the
[sample numeric session](
  {{ site.baseurl }}/sessions/simple-numeric-session.txt) presented in class.
2) Bind symbols `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2` to real numbers. Interpret the
"x pair" as one point in 2-space and the "y pair" as another point in 2-space.
Write a sequence of one or more forms to compute the distance between these two
points.
3) Save the session to a file named
[`numeric-session.txt`](
  {{ site.baseurl }}/sessions/numeric-session.txt) for subsequent use.

# Processing Session

1) Simply duplicate the sample session presented in class which featured
[`car` and `cdr`]({{ site.baseurl }}/sessions/car-cdr-session.txt).
2) Simply duplicate the sample session presented in class which featured
[`cons`]({{ site.baseurl }}/sessions/cons-session.txt).
3) Simply duplicate the sample session presented in class which featured
[`referencers`]({{ site.baseurl }}/sessions/referencers-session.txt).
4) Simply duplicate the sample session presented in class which featured
`constructors`.
5) Bind the symbol colors to a list of your three favorite colors. Then, type
each of the following forms:
  - `'colors`
  - `colors`
  - `(describe 'colors)`
  - `(describe colors)`
  - `(type-of 'colors)`
  - `(type-of colors)`
6) Write one simple, moderately imaginative form which features `car`, a second
which features `cdr`, a third which features `cons`, and a fourth which features
`list`, and a fifth which features `append`.
7) Save the session to a file named
[`lp-session.txt`](
  {{ site.baseurl }}/sessions/lp-session.txt) for subsequent use.
